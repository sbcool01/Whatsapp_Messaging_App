This project is an attempt to replicate the core functionality of very popular messaging app, Whatsapp. Here, I have used Parse-server to host the data online. Here, log-in and log-out page is also included (which is infrequent functionality of whatsapp) which enables the user to better understand the working of app and make it more transparent.

The app developed is tested and can be used very effectively for messaging.
